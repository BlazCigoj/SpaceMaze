# Auto Completing Space Maze

This project is an AI-powered maze solver that automatically completes a 3D space maze. The AI uses pathfinding algorithms (like A* or DFS) to navigate the maze and find the most efficient path to the exit, without any human interaction. The maze and AI's progress are visualized in real-time in a 3D environment.

## Features
- Generates random 3D mazes
- Autonomous maze solving using AI algorithms
- Real-time visualization of the maze-solving process

Enjoy exploring how the AI solves the maze automatically!
